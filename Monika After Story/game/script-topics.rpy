#Incomplete ideas#
##################
#Favorite food

#How did she become self aware (Could possibly expand on the lore of her club president role giving her self-awareness and omniscience. ~ John)

#More writing tips

#The player is wasting their time (I don't think Monika would say this, considering her personality revolves around loving the player. ~ John)

#Look for your computer for porn, comment on what she finds (Would this even be possible? ~ John)

#What kind of girls do you like? Do you wish monika was more like that? (This seems to relate to the "archetypes" label. - Rune)

#Play a poem game with monika, she calls you out for just stringing together random words

#Comment when it's getting late. Say that the player should go to bed, say goodnight then close the game.

###Some ideas to consider:
#What she used to do in free time

#Thoughts on few of countries in real world (I mean; she has some knowledge of real world that most people don't even think about)

#What does she think would happen if the player did not start the game; she mentioned that the player "saved" her by being with
#her in topic 13

#Has she written any other poems? If anyone's good at her type of poetry, another poem from her could be a great idea, right?

#What would she do or what would be the first thing she would do if she managed to get out of the game into the real world?
#Think of possible limitations, like having no body? (Something like this has been written)
###

#---
#some other ideas i had in mind, but not sure if want to / dont know how to implement
#so i figure i'll stick them right next to the others, if you dont mind
#---

#favorite animal, not sure what to write however

#holidays, probably should be special greetings for another file though

#remind the player to use the 't' key to talk, maybe if player doesnt talk in a very long time

#her phone number, it wouldnt matter in her reality, maybe?

#disrespectful comments towards monika

#worst topic suggestion: 'memes'.

#if the player is on a laptop or battery, monika will remind to make sure to charge it, if possible?

#originally i wrote a topic "i hate you" or something similar, but i didnt like how it turned out when i finished it, so maybe another time

#i also originally wrote a topic about money, but didnt like how it came out, so probably rewrite later, me having horrible money management skills doesnt help

#monika talking about her room and about her house?

#wanted to write about natsukis cupcakes, but didnt know how to write the end the conversation

#encourage player to take a rest after long periods of programs such as MS word/Xcode open (is it even possible? -Yuki)
